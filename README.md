# JPG_large toJPG

This is a tiny Powershell/CMD script which converts all '.jgp_large' files in the directory the script is located in to '.jpg' files. Twitter on the desktop downloads images as '.jgp_large'. I use the Windows 7 photo viewer on Windows 10 via a workaround so it is easier to change the file extensions than it is to have '.jgp_large' open in photo viewer.

The actual command executes in powershell but CMD is used to create a .cmd file which can be clicked on to activate.
